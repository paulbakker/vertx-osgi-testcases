# vertx-osgi-testcases

Bndtools workspace to support the effort to add OSGi manifests to all Vert.x modules. This workspace contains test cases for the work being completed this far.

The workspace contains a few wrapper bundles for dependencies that are not (valid) OSGi bundles. Wrapping these bundles is only to support the Vert.x test cases, and are not tested for completeness.
